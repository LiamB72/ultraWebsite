    <!-- TO DO:
        - Finish the texts for the weapons, chapters and techs. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Do the CSS for all of it. (in progress [Liam])
        - Add the alternate images for the shotgun and nailgun. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Correct the grammar of about every text (if there is any error :p). (in progress[Liam&Stormy])
        - Start work on the index.html page, as in maybe have an overview of the game with some images?
            + Was thinking of copying and pasting the steam description of the game as it's pretty clear.
            + Add a place to honour the devs who worked on the game
        - Could replace the home button that is redundant with a Pop culture one where we talk /
            + about the content made around it (memes, animations, etc...) (in progress [Liam])
        - Do the Pop Culture page

                <b>ULTRAKILL</b> is a fast-paced ultraviolent retro FPS combining the skill-based style 
                scoring from character action games with unadulterated carnage inspired by the 
                best shooters of the '90s. Rip apart your foes with varied destructive weapons and 
                shower in their blood to regain your health.
                its developpement was started by Arsi Patala who is kown online as hakita (see picture below) 
                in 2020 where he published the first dev log of the game to his youtube channel under the name hakita.

                He has stated it to be inspired by multiple old shooters like doom classic and arena shooters like quake,
                both games having had a huge impact on games as a whole but also being seen heavily in <b>ULTRAKILL</b>.
                All in the level design, the weapons, all reminiscent of the classic fps feel and even more noticeble
                in the graphics, with them being purposefully retro and low poly.
