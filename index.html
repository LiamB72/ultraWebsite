                <span class="ultrakill">ULTRAKILL</span>'s steam page description says this about it: "<span class="ultrakill">ULTRAKILL</span> is a fast-paced
                ultraviolent retro FPS combining the skill-based style scoring from character action games with 
                unadulterated carnage inspired by the best shooters of the '90s. Rip apart your foes with varied 
                destructive weapons and shower in their blood to regain your health."
                <br>Its development was started by <a class="link" href="https://x.com/hakitadev">Arsi Patala</a>, aka Hakita (see picture below)
                He published his first dev log on 01/02/2018 to his YouTube channel, though the game was only released
                in early access on steam the third of september 2020 so almost 3 years later through New Blood Interactive,
                a game publisher that mainly takes care of games similar to <span class="ultrakill">ULTRAKILL</span> like Dusk.

                He has stated it to be inspired by multiple old shooters like doom classic and arena shooters like quake,
                both games having had a huge impact on games as a whole but also being seen heavily in <span class="ultrakill">ULTRAKILL</span>.
                All in the level design, the weapons, all reminiscent of the classic fps feel and even more noticeable
                in the graphics, with them being purposefully retro and low poly.
                <br>It is, however, important to note that while hakita started this alone as a passion project, the scope of
                it grew and there is now a small team of devs that work on the game with 2 main ones, Hakita whom we've just 
                mentioned and PITR who, according to Hakita himself, is a much better coder than him.
