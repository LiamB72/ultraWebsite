    <!-- TO DO:
        - Finish the texts for the weapons, chapters and techs. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Do the CSS for all of it. (in progress [Liam])
        - Add the alternate images for the shotgun and nailgun. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Correct the grammar of about every text (if there is any error :p). (in progress[Liam&Stormy])
        - Start work on the index.html page, as in maybe have an overview of the game with some images?
            + Was thinking of copying and pasting the steam description of the game as it's pretty clear.
            + Add a place to honour the devs who worked on the game
        - Could replace the home button that is redundant with a Pop culture one where we talk /
            + about the content made around it (memes, animations, etc...) (in progress [Liam])
        - Do the Pop Culture page

            <p>
                <b>ULTRAKILL</b>'s steam page description says this about it: "<b>ULTRAKILL</b> is a fast-paced 
                ultraviolent retro FPS combining the skill-based style scoring from character action games with 
                unadulterated carnage inspired by the best shooters of the '90s. Rip apart your foes with varied 
                destructive weapons and shower in their blood to regain your health."
                <br>Its developpement was started by Arsi Patala who is kown online as hakita (see picture below) 
                He published his first dev log on 01/02/2018 to his youtube channel though the game was only released 
                in early access on steam the third of september 2020 so almost 3 years later through New Blood Interactive,
                a game publisher that mainly takes care of games similar to <b>ULTRAKILL</b> like Dusk.
            </p>

                He has stated it to be inspired by multiple old shooters like doom classic and arena shooters like quake,
                both games having had a huge impact on games as a whole but also being seen heavily in <b>ULTRAKILL</b>.
                All in the level design, the weapons, all reminiscent of the classic fps feel and even more noticeble
                in the graphics, with them being purposefully retro and low poly.
                <br>It is however important to note that while hakita started this alone as a passion project, the scope of 
                it grew and there is now a small team of devs that work on the game with 2 main ones, Hakita whom we've just 
                mentioned and PITR who according to Hakita himself is a much better coder than him.
