    <!-- TO DO:
        - Finish the texts for the weapons, chapters and techs. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Do the CSS for all of it. (in progress [Liam])
        - Add the alternate images for the shotgun and nailgun. (in progress [Stormy])
        - Correct the grammar of about every text (if there is any error :p). (in progress[ Stormy])
        - Start work on the index.html page, as in maybe have an overview of the  /
            game with some images? was thinking copy pasting the steam description of the game as it's pretty clear. /
            + Add a place to honor the devs who worked on the game
        - Could replace the home button that is redundant with a Pop culture one where we talk /
            about the content made around it (memes, animations, etc) (in progress [Liam])
        - Do the Pop Culture page
