                        The core eject shotgun is pretty simple, left click for a shotgun shot with rather large spread and right click 
                        to charge up an explosive core that can then be shot by any hitscan weapon in the game. it is great for single 
                        target damage and health because it makes the ennemies hit bleed a lot contrary to the pisotl/revolver that doesn't
                        give much health. contrary to the pistol however, the left click isn't entierely useless as it posses one of, if 
                        not the best feature in the entire game, projectile boosting which alllows you to punch your own bullets when you 
                        fire the weapon. this requires somewhat good timing to get the punching windows however once learned and automated 
                        it becomes second nature. an important thing to note about this feature is that at first it was a bug due to the
                        way the shotgun was coded as it was simply a copy and paste from the swordsmachine code whose shotgun shots you 
                        can parry to send back to explode, hakita found this so fun that he decided not to remove it and instead make it 
                        a fully fledged feature. Now for the alt fire, as i said you can shoot the core with a hitscan but there is a lot 
                        you can do with this such as shooting it with the malicious railcannon to create a nuke that deals insane amounts 
                        of damage that can one shot cerberus unfortunate enough to find themselves in the blast radius. however you sadly 
                        cannot projectile boost it even if it's a non hitscan projectile. NB: coin shots will target these if they are in 
                        the sight of the coin instead of going to the nearest ennemy but this will add damage to the explosion, this works 
                        both with a regular revolver coin shot, the electric railcannon but most fun is the malicious which will make an 
                        even stronger nuke. Now after this yapping it's time to talk about the alt core eject, aka the jackhammer core eject.
                        this weapon like the other jackhammers gains damage based on the player speed at the moment of impact through 
                        releasing a piston, this piston can transform the core eject into a hitscan explosion, however hitscan means that 
                        it can now hit coins, this means that you can create an orbital nuke if the coins are shot properely which is a lot 
                        of fun but essentially useless in regular play and only serves as a cool thing to do in the sandbox.

                        the pump charge has the same wide spread as the core eject but with the the right click charing up the shotgun 
                        up to 3 times. when charged up twice you recieve no damage and get more pellets and a better projectile boost 
                        but if you charge it up thrice the shotgun will explode when shot dealing 50 damage to you but also dealing a 
                        lot of damage to the ennemies in the blast radius, this damage can be negated with a carefully timed dash to 
                        abuse the I-frames of it. the double charge plus knukleblaster can be used to one shot a maurice due to the big 
                        single target damage up close and the triple pump to gain good height for speedruns or even distance though slam 
                        storage long jump or dash jump is more useful and doesn't have the downside of the potential damage taken. the 
                        jackhammer pump functions the same with each pump making it so the impact shot deals more damage and the third 
                        pump making an explosion. overall the pump jackhammer can be better suited for single target damage though you 
                        loose out on projectile boosting and shotgun swapping depending on what other shotguns you have and in what slot 
                        it is. plus the pump jackhammer in particular requires a lot more game knowledge and anticipation than the others 
                        as it has a higher potential for damage when charged but if you don't it kinda blows but it's well the time to 
                        learn as it can be useful in the cyber grind to stun hideous masses with enough speed and a good hit on the tail.

                        The sawed off has actually a tighter spread compared to the other 2 shotguns with the same amount of damage. no one
                        gives a shit about the damage of the left click though as its worth is in the right click which charges up a chainsaw
                        that's attached on a cable. when released the chainsaw will launch off and come back to you dealing damage both ways
                        to ennemies in its path. the good thing is that this can be rebounded with the feedbacker, adding damage to the 
                        chainsaw and this can be done infinitely many times stacking damage till the end of times. using the knukleblaster 
                        however will instead detach the projectile and this will then bounce off a few surfaces before disintegrating. this 
                        broken off verion can actually be included in sawblade trapas as it is magnetic and can also serve as a conductor for
                        the jumpstart. the jackhammer variant is functionally the same, still keeping the more speed = more damage of the 
                        weapon but for this the blast of the left click jackhammer can also serve as a means to rebound the chainsaw after it 
                        is fired though it requires tighter timing due to the delay in the left click for these weapons.
