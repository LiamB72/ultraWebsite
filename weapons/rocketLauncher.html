                        The freezeframe rocket launcher and the rocket launchers in general are unlocked in 5-3 ship of fools 
                        at the midway part of the level just before the ship turns upside down and you have to make your way 
                        back to the entrance which is now the exit. the left click fires a simple rocket that will deal knockback
                        to nearby ennemies if it doesn't hit anything and a yellow explosion if it does hit an ennemy. 
                        the way the gun reloads makes rocket swapping impossible which is big le bad. however to make up for 
                        this horrendous if you hit an ennemy with a rocket while said ennemy is in mid air the yellow booom will
                        be replaced by a red one dealing double damage. this does require a somewhat good amount of skill as 
                        you need to predict where the ennemy is going to be when the rocket reaches his y axis. now for the right 
                        click ability, this one will freeze the rocket for up to 5 seconds with a 10 second cooldown but you can
                        just right click again even during this cooldown to freeze some more rockets, after one second of being
                        frozen however the rockets become freeze charged and on impact will deal a red exxplosion, this is 
                        notciced by the orange stripes of the rocket turning blue with an audible zap sfx at the same time. these 
                        rockets can then be shot with the baja blast for an explosion almost as big as the core eject + nuke 
                        combo. none of this matters whoever because the best usage of the freezeframe is the ability to easily 
                        rocket ride by either rc+fire+jump+dash+rc to get on the rocket when on the ground and stationary or by 
                        being in mid air, firering a rocket slightly underneath you while freezeframed, dashing and unfreezing 
                        to land on top of the rocket. there are other ways but no one uses them or cares enough about them so 
                        meh. finally a niche usage of the freezeframe is the ability to freeze rockets from guttertanks allowing
                        you to jump onto them and redirecting them towards anything you want by riding and creating a red 
                        explosion on impact with an ennemy also being able to one shot guttertanks.

                    <p>
                        The S.R.S which i will now write srs because i don't want to write all the dots all the time when refering 
                        to this weapon is the green variant of the rocket launcher. the left click is exactly the same as the blue 
                        variant just like with every other weapon in the game excluding the railguns because they want to be special. 
                        so what makes this weapon interesting the right click which fires out a litteral cannon ball. this ball is a 
                        non hitscan projectile which means it can be projectile booster like a shotgun blast. the ball will simple 
                        disintegrate when it hits a surface that isn't an ennmy and bounce upwards when it does actually hit an ennmy. 
                        this means that you can hit an ennmy with it, and projectile boost the ball afterwards dealing even more 
                        damage. note that the ball can be grappled towards you so if you are dumb enough to want to use this at longer 
                        ranges you can though when projectile boosted the ball will explode on any contact so be somewhat smart about 
                        it since it does have a somewhat long cooldown. there is a few tech bits you can do with it such as instakilling
                        a cerberus by hitting it with the ball first then projectile boosting it into it again, another good use of 
                        this gun is its ability to stun insurectionists though in regular play it isn't all that interesting and 
                        actually comes in handy in the cybergrind as those are ennemies you want to prioritise or at least have out of
                        your way to deal with other threats. there is also a tech called my balls explode where you fire the canon ball 
                        normally and shoot it with a hitscan weapon to make it detonate creating a short lingering explosion ball that can be 
                        quite handy to kill fodder ennemies like filth and obvioulsy hitting it with a baja blast makes a red explosion because 
                        it would be pretty lame otherwise.

                        The firestarter is the last of the weapons in the game with some semi interesting tech. left click is 
                        still the same cause why the hell would it change? anyways the right click will just spill oil on the
                        floor that you can light on fire to deal damage to both yourself and ennemies. the oil will actually 
                        eliminate all friction from walking which means you can use it to preserve speed and have faster dashjumps
                        because you don't loose momentum from touching the floor. this oil can also be applied to walls and 
                        ceilings but that isn't really useful. underwater however the oil will simply explode when you put it on 
                        fire. this oil can be applied to ennemies however which will just set them on fire, what else did you really
                        expect from it? this does have special properties such as making oiled up maurices vulnerable to explosions 
                        which is the only way to achieve this. some ennemies will also actually take extra fire damage such as the 
                        flesh panopticon, the insurrectionist and of couse sisiphus prime, cause, well reasons.
