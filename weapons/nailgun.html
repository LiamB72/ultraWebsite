                        the attractor nailgun fires, you guessed it nails, nails that can be caught in a 
                        trap using the right click magnets of the gun creating a nail trap, this however 
                        is kinda pointless and few poeple use this. most sensible people will go for the 
                        alt sawblade launcher that fires sawblades instead of puny nails. this is extremely 
                        useful for all aspects of the game as it can deal with both large groups of foder 
                        ennemies as well as bosses with a sawblade setup though the timing of the magnets
                        needs to be on point otherwise they disintegrate and your trap is ruined. Another 
                        more recent usage of the nails, sawblade and magnet is with the jumpstart nail gun 
                        as these elements will greatly help conduct the electric shock from the weapon 
                        allowing ypiercerthat is very versatile as it can be utilised in essentially everyroom due 
                        to the somewhat small size of the trap with the only thing to be careful with is 
                        if the blades are hitting surface and bouncing off as this can very quickly destroy 
                        them with the repeated ricoches.

                        the overheat nailgun posses a slower left click however each shot will increase the heat
                        gauge of the weapon, allowing you to release a large amount of firery nails very quickly
                        with a right click. the fire will increase damage to certain ennemies like the
                        insurectionist while reducing it on ennemies such as the schism. you have 2 charges of
                        this which each take 8 seconds to recharge. a good usage of the weapon as the burst
                        posses large spread is to fire shoot another variant of the nailgun then quickly 
                        switch to the overheat to fire as any shot from the other types will instantly charge
                        up the overheat to the maximum. these nails as said in the attractor nailgun section
                        help conduct the charge from the jumpstart. as such, it can be very useful to fire
                        out a bunch of nails using the right click in order to cover most of the arena 
                        with nails which then deal swaths of damage to all nearby ennemies. this tech is 
                        most useful in the cybergrind as you have a small window of time between waves 
                        that can allow you to unleash all these nails in peace. the alt fire replaces the
                        large amount of nails with a single yellow blade with the right click with the left 
                        click simply releasing small and weak gray blades. the alt fire's penetration and so
                        lifetime will depend on how much heat was in the weapon before the alt fire was 
                        released, adding another layer to a good sawblade trap.

                        the jumpstart is one of the newer weapons introduced in the arsenal update but 
                        it has already cimented itself as a weapon of choice for any situation due to its 
                        high single and multi target damage. both the main and alt variant have meh left 
                        click ability but it shines again through the alt fire. this alt fire fires a wire 
                        that can connect to ennemies and then charges up, when it is fully charged it released 
                        a blast of electricity which can bounce of off ennemies, the range will depend on how
                        many metallic objects are near the ennemy when the blast is released and how they are 
                        positioned. many things count as metallic objects for the blast to bounce off of, notably 
                        coins, all projectiles from the nailguns/sawblades, rockets though this is only useful 
                        if using the freezeframe ability making it hard to implement and the chainsaw from the 
                        sawed-of.
