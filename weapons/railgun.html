                        The piercing gatorade is a very powerful hitscan weapon with infinite pierce that does 8 damage to all ennemies in 
                        its path as shown when you pick it up in 2-2. it has a universal 16 second cooldown which means that the cooldown is 
                        the same for all other variants but  the cooldown will be taken into account even if you change your weapon to another 
                        one. this cooldown is indicated in the bottom of your screen if you have the default UI layout and it is shown with 
                        the blue lightning rod that will slowly fill up over time after the gun is shot. This weapon's power is most used for 
                        railcoining as discussed in the marksman page though with the arsenal update its usage has increased slightly with the 
                        electric shock it now gives to both V1 and nearby ennemies when fired in water though this is only ever useful to know 
                        in 5-3 as the level is by default filled with water unless you for for the challenge route but even then you still have
                        water where you can operate this tech. it doesn't posses any right click ability to speak of at it only zooms your 
                        vision, suposedly to make hiting far away targets like coins and ennemies easier for you though no one really uses 
                        it past a certain skil point as any precision aiming looses time and it would be easier to just graple anyway.

                        No one uses the drill. though if you may know, it's unlocked from the terminal for 100k points and serves more as a healing
                        device for people with skill issues than anything else. it fires a non hitscan drill that laches onto ennemies and starts 
                        dealing small continuous damage to the target over 7.5 seconds giving out large amounts of blood. you can also punch the drill 
                        while it's in an ennemy to instandly deal the remaining damage and if your aim is good enough you can punch it into anothe ennemy 
                        resetting the timer and the damage starts over again. if the ennemy you fired the drill on has so little health that it is one 
                        shot by the initial damage from contact, the drill will just pierce it, killing it in the process and can attach itself to any 
                        ennemy behind it. the long cooldown for the railcannons and the very limited tech of the drill makes it useless to players with 
                        higher skill and serves more as a crutch for newer players attempting difficult bossfights, namely minos and sisiphuse prime. 
                        the drill is however metalic meaning it can conduct the jumpstart shocks. it can also serve to restrain mindflayers for the 
                        duration of the drill making them unable to teleport which is about the only use of it for high skill players but even then they 
                        would be better off railcoining the thing instead because it's an insta kill and is cooler.

                        The baja blast is the last railcannon you unlock costing 100k points from the terminal just like the drill. it fires a yellow hitscan
                        explosion that does good damage in a large radius with zero damage falloff making it very good against group of fodder ennemies and 
                        single tanky like cerberi alike. the shot being hitscan means it can bounce off coins that just like with any other thing in this game 
                        will add damage to the explosion making it somewhat useful in the cybergrind though it's not the most efficient use of both the coins 
                        due to the long cooldown and the long recharge time for a kinda small explosion. real gamers will use a nuke, a nuke is when you fire 
                        a core from the core eject shotgun and then shoot it with the baja blast. this creates a large red explostion powerful enough to insta 
                        kill cerberi in the main blast zone and serverly weakening those in the secondary radius, this is mostly seen in the weezer room as it 
                        serves to quickly dispatch the 4 cerberi with ease to only have to deal with the ferryman
