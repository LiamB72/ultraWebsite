                        The piercing gatorade is a very powerful hitscan weapon with infinite pierce that does 8 damage to all enemies in
                        its path as shown when you pick it up in 2â€“2. It has a universal 16-second cooldown which means that the cooldown is
                        the same for all other variants, but the cooldown will be taken into account even if you change your weapon to another
                        one. This cooldown is indicated in the bottom of your screen if you have the default UI layout, and it is shown with
                        the blue lightning rod that will slowly fill up over time after the gun is shot. This weapon's power is most used for 
                        railcoining as discussed in the marksman page though with the arsenal update its usage has increased slightly with the 
                        electric shock it now gives to both V1 and nearby enemies when fired in water, though this is only ever useful to know
                        in 5-3 as the level is by default filled with water unless you for the challenge route but even then you still have
                        water where you can operate this tech. it doesn't possess any right click ability to speak of at it only zooms your
                        vision, supposed to make hit far away targets like coins and enemies easier, for you thought no one really uses
                        it past a certain skill point as any precision aiming lose time, and it would be easier to just grapple anyway.

                        No one uses the drill. Though if you may know, it's unlocked from the terminal for 100k points and serves more as a healing
                        device for people with skill issues than anything else. It fires a non hitscan drill that latches onto enemies and starts
                        dealing small continuous damage to the target over 7.5 seconds, giving out large amounts of blood. You can also punch the drill
                        while it's in an enemy to instantly deal with the remaining damage. Additionally, if your aim is good enough, you can punch it into anothe ennemy
                        resetting the timer and the damage starts over again. If the enemy you fired the drill on has so little health that it is one
                        shot by the initial damage from contact, the drill will just pierce it, killing it in the process and can attach itself to any 
                        enemy behind it. The long cooldown for the railcannons and the very limited tech of the drill makes it useless to players with
                        higher skill and serves more as a crutch for newer players attempting difficult bossfights, namely minos and Sisyphus prime.
                        The drill is, however, metallic, meaning it can conduct jumpstart shocks. It can also serve to restrain mindflayers for the
                        duration of the drill, making them unable to teleport, which is about the only use of it for high skill players. However, even then they
                        would be better off railcoining the thing instead because it's an insta-kill and is cooler.

                        The baja blast is the last railcannon you unlock costing 100k points from the terminal just like the drill. It fires a yellow hitscan
                        explosion that does good damage in a large radius with zero damage falloffs, making it excellent against group of fodder enemies and
                        single tanky like cerberi alike. the shot being hitscan means it can bounce off coins that, just like with any other thing in this game,
                        will add damage to the explosion, making it somewhat useful in the Cybergrind, though it's not the most efficient use of both the coins
                        due to the long cooldown and the long recharge time for a kinda small explosion. Real gamers will use a nuke, a nuke is when you fire
                        a core from the core eject shotgun and then shoot it with the baja blast. This creates a large red explosion powerful enough to insta-
                        kill cerberi in the main blast zone and serverly weakening those in the secondary radius, this is mostly seen in the weezer room as it
                        serves to quickly dispatch the 4 cerberi with ease to only have to deal with the ferryman
