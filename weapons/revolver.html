            <div id="piercer">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>The piercer is the most basic gun in the game possesing a regular left click shot that does from 1 to 2 
                        damage depending on what ennemy spot was hit. this weapon also has an alt fire in the form of a charged shot
                        <br>that does 2 damage and pierces up to 3 ennemies. however it doesn't really have any interesting 
                        properties on its own. it is however useful when combined with other weapons lke the marksman for
                        <br> an ultraricoshot which can deal a lot of single target damage with the charged shot but even that 
                        is rarely used. instead people will much prefer to use the alt piercer, aka slab piercer as soon as it
                        <br> is unlocked in 1-4 for its higher based damage of 2 no matter what ennemy spot is hit, a more 
                        powerful piercing shot even if it still only pierces 3 ennemies and let's be honest with ourselves, 
                        it both looks and sounds way cooler than the default. To get this cooler older brother
                        <br> of a gun however you will need to click on all 4 stone slabs (hence the name) that are 
                        found throughout the limbo layer. in the community the default pierces is often memed on and used in the 
                        <br> mayo% speedrun category based off of the a review of ultrakill from underthemayo, an 
                        uninformed and dumb reviewer who cries over every game that isn't doom eternal. in his ultrakill
                        <br> review he critisised the game for not intising players to use other guns than the default 
                        piercer as you can beat it all without having to use other guns or weapons, completely missing the point
                        <br> that playing that game that way is stupid, unfun and ineficient but no matter to him cause he is always right.

            <!-- ============= MARKSMAN  ============= -->
            <div id="marksman">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>The marksman is often touted as the best weapon in the game for its strong pairing with other
                        weapons with its alt fire. the left click shot is the same as the piercer like all revolvers 
                        even with the slab marksman however that is not what is interesting about it. instead the alt 
                        fire consists in shooting coins into the air that when shot with a hitscan weapon will imediatly 
                        target the nearest ennemy weakpoint and adding a flat damange bonus. with the default gun, this 
                        shot can be split if the coins is shot right when it flashes or when it starts singing from being 
                        in the air for long enough. with the slab variant, the shots no longer split instead instantly 
                        reseting the weapon fire cooldown for all slabs revolvers if, again, the timing on the shot is 
                        correct. now flat damage bonuses don't sound very cool on their own however combined with other 
                        weapons it becomes lethal. the best example of this power is through a railcoin where you take an 
                        ennemy, toss 2 coins behind it, shoot them with your railcannon and toss the 2 last coins for a 
                        total of 27 damage, a more situational use of the marksman is with the tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch 
                        a complex strategy that can deal over 32 dmg if executed well enough. but there is virtually no 
                        limit to the marksman coins as it only needs a hitscan shot to be used. finally, the coins can 
                        be used to conduct electricity but that will be detailed in the jumpstart section [insert link here maybe?].

            <!-- ============= SHARPSHOOTER  ============= -->
            <div id="sharpshooter">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed non risus.
                        The Sharpshooter is the last of the pistols with the left click fire just doing from 1 to 2 dmg like
                        the other weapons and the corresponding slab attack is the same as the other 2 pistols. the point of 
                        the marksman is, again in its alt fire. on the basic sharpshooter, you get 3 red shots that recharge 
                        over [insert time to charge here], these shots can bounce off walls to target the nearest ennemy weakpoint 
                        and explode projectiles creating a red explosion [also have a page about this?] dealing great damage. 
                        the downside of this attack is the spin up time as you need to have your right click pressed down to start 
                        the chargup of the gun. this spin up time is solved with the slab version which while it may only have one 
                        shot, is more powerful, doesn't require spin up time at all and stops targetting ennemy weakpoints and while 
                        this sounds bad it acutally helps in dealing more consistent damage as the shot stays straigt and it allows 
                        you to, you maybe guessed it, stack coins onto the shot to reset the total amount of bounces of the shot which 
                        makes it great at both single and multi target damage.
