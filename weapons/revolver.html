                    <p>The piercer is the most basic gun in the game possesing a regular left click shot that does from 1 to 2 
                        damage depending on what ennemy spot was hit. this weapon also has an alt fire in the form of a charged shot
                        <br>that does 2 damage and pierces up to 3 ennemies. however it doesn't really have any interesting 
                        properties on its own. it is however useful when combined with other weapons lke the marksman for
                        <br> an ultraricoshot which can deal a lot of single target damage with the charged shot but even that 
                        is rarely used. instead people will much prefer to use the alt piercer, aka slab piercer as soon as it
                        <br> is unlocked in 1-4 for its higher based damage of 2 no matter what ennemy spot is hit, a more 
                        powerful piercing shot even if it still only pierces 3 ennemies and let's be honest with ourselves, 
                        it both looks and sounds way cooler than the default. To get this cooler older brother
                        <br> of a gun however you will need to click on all 4 stone slabs (hence the name) that are 
                        found throughout the limbo layer. in the community the default pierces is often memed on and used in the 
                        <br> mayo% speedrun category based off of the a review of ultrakill from underthemayo, an 
                        uninformed and dumb reviewer who cries over every game that isn't doom eternal. in his ultrakill
                        <br> review he critisised the game for not intising players to use other guns than the default 
                        piercer as you can beat it all without having to use other guns or weapons, completely missing the point
                        <br> that playing that game that way is stupid, unfun and ineficient but no matter to him cause he is always right.

                <div class="description">
                    <p>The marksman is often touted as the best weapon in the game for its strong pairing with other weapons with its 
                        alt fire. It is unlocked whenever the player spends the 7.5k points at the terminal to unlock it with no other 
                        requirements. the left click shot is the same as the piercer like all revolvers even with the slab marksman 
                        however that is not what is interesting about it. instead the alt fire consists in shooting coins into the air 
                        that when shot with a hitscan weapon will imediatly target the nearest ennemy weakpoint and adding a flat damange 
                        bonus. with the default gun, this shot can be split if the coins is shot right when it flashes or when it starts 
                        singing from being in the air for long enough. with the slab variant, the shots no longer split instead instantly 
                        reseting the weapon fire cooldown for all slabs revolvers if, again, the timing on the shot is correct. now flat 
                        damage bonuses don't sound very cool on their own however combined with other weapons it becomes lethal. the best 
                        example of this power is through a railcoin where you take an ennemy, toss 2 coins behind it, shoot them with your 
                        railcannon and toss the 2 last coins for a total of 27 damage, a more situational use of the marksman is with the 
                        tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch a complex strategy that can deal over 32 dmg if executed well enough, this is very good 
                        in combination with a deadcoin for the initial burst of damage which renders the damage potential of this attack 
                        virtually infinite if you are given an infinite amount of time, though the dialogue before the bossfights that 
                        would actually require such a setup give you more than enough time to deadcoin and get yourself into position for 
                        the tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch after the deadcoin has been setup enough. There is essentially no limit to the marksman 
                        coins as it only needs a hitscan shot to be used. finally, the coins can be used to conduct electricity but that will 
                        be detailed in the jumpstart section [insert link here maybe?].

            <!-- ============= SHARPSHOOTER  ============= -->
            <div id="red-borders">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        The Sharpshooter is the last of the pistols that is unlocked in the terminal for 25k points making it harder 
                        to get when starting out as a new player because you most likely won't have that amount of points until later 
                        in the game. the left click fire just does from 1 to 2 dmg like the other weapons and the corresponding slab 
                        attack is the same as the other 2 pistols. the point of the marksman is, again in its alt fire. on the basic 
                        sharpshooter, you get 3 red shots that recharge over [insert time to charge here], these shots can bounce off 
                        walls to target the nearest ennemy weakpoint and explode projectiles creating a red explosion [also have a page 
                        about this?] dealing great damage. the downside of this attack is the spin up time as you need to have your right 
                        click pressed down to start the chargup of the gun. this spin up time is solved with the slab version which while 
                        it may only have one shot, is more powerful, doesn't require spin up time at all and stops targetting ennemy
                        weakpoints and while this sounds bad it acutally helps in dealing more consistent damage as the shot stays 
                        straigt and it allows you to, you maybe guessed it, stack coins onto the shot to reset the total amount of bounces 
                        of the shot which makes it great at both single and multi target damage. as talked about in the marksman, the 
                        sharpshooter is a part of the most complex single weapon strategy in the game: the tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch. 
                        this attack utilises the bounce resseting property of coins to continually pierce an ennemy twice per round. to 
                        set it up, first you take a large ennemy, move back and while you are moving back, fire a coin, the moment it is 
                        fired move back forward to punch it into the ennemy infront, then aim at the ground with the slab marksman, fire 
                        a shot, look back at the ennemy and punch the coin that should have reached knee height by now, go to the side 
                        and use the grapple to juggle coins upwards, jump to punch the coin into the ennemy, slam back down and repeat 
                        until you have ran out of coins.
