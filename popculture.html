    <!-- TO DO:
        Add a background image. DONE
        Add a black box sort of colour onto of the background image (the div that contains the text&all). DONE
        Finish the texts for the weapons, chapters and techs. in progress(stormy)
        Do the CSS for all of it.
        Add the alternate images for the shotgun and nailgun. in progress(stormy)
        Correct the grammar of about every text (if there is any error :p). in progress(stormy)
        Start work on the index.html page, as in maybe have an overview of the game with some images? was thinking copy pasting the steam description of the game as it's pretty clear.
        Could replace the home button that is redundant with a Pop culture one where we talk about the content made around it (memes, animations, etc)
