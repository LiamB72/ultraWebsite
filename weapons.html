                                    The piercer is the most basic gun in the game, possessing a regular left click shot that does from 1 to 2
                                    damage depending on what an enemy spot was hit. This weapon also has an alt fire in the form of a charged
                                    shot that does 2 damage and pierces up to three enemies. However, it doesn't really have any interesting
                                    properties on its own. It is, however, useful when combined with other weapons like the marksman for an
                                    ultraricoshot which can deal a lot of single target damage with the charged shot, but even that is rarely used.
                                    Instead, people will much prefer to use the alt piercer, aka slab piercer as soon as it is unlocked in 1–4 for
                                    its higher based damage of 2, no matter what enemy's spot is hit, a more powerful piercing shot even
                                    it both looks and sounds way cooler than the default. To get this cooler older brother of a gun, however, you will
                                    need to click on all four stone slabs (hence the name) that are found throughout
                                    the limbo layer. In the community, the default piercer is often meme'd on and used in the mayo%
                                    speedrun category based on a review of Ultrakill from underthemayo, an uninformed and dumb reviewer
                                    who cries over every game that isn't doom eternal. in his Ultrakill review, he criticized the game
                                    for not insisting players to use other guns than the default piercer as you can beat it all without
                                    having to use other guns or weapons, completely missing the point that playing that game that way
                                    is stupid, not fun and inefficient but no matter to him because he is always right.

                                    The marksman is often thought as the best weapon in the game for its strong pairing with other weapons with its
                                    alt fire. It is unlocked whenever the player spends the 7.5k points at the terminal to unlock it with no other
                                    requirements. The left click shot is the same as the piercer like all revolvers even with the slab marksman,
                                    however, that is not what is interesting about it. Instead, the alt fire consists in shooting coins into the air
                                    that when shot with a hitscan weapon will immediately target the nearest enemy weakpoint and adding a flat damage
                                    bonus. With the default gun, this shot can be split if the coins are shot right when it flashes or when it starts
                                    singing from being in the air for long enough. With the slab variant, the shots no longer split instead of instantly
                                    resetting the weapon fire cooldown for all slabs revolvers if, again, the timing on the shot is correct. Now flat
                                    damage bonuses don't sound very cool on their own; however, combined with other weapons, it becomes lethal. the best
                                    example of this power is through a railcoin where you take an enemy, toss 2 coins behind it, shoot them with your
                                    railcannon and toss the 2 last coins for a total of 27 damage, a more situational use of the marksman is with the
                                    tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch a complex strategy that can deal over 32 dmg if executed well enough, this is very good
                                    in combination with a deadcoin for the initial burst of damage which renders the damage potential of this attack
                                    virtually infinite if you are given an infinite amount of time, though the dialogue before the boss fights that
                                    would actually require such a setup give you more than enough time to deadcoin and get yourself into position for
                                    the tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch after the deadcoin has been setup enough. There is essentially no limit to the marksman
                                    coins as it only needs a hitscan shot to be used. Finally, the coins can be used to conduct electricity but that will
                                    be detailed in the jumpstart section [insert link here maybe?].

                                    The Sharpshooter is the last of the pistols that is unlocked in the terminal for 25k points, making it harder
                                    to get when starting out as a new player because you most likely won't have that number of points until later
                                    in the game. The left click fire just does from 1 to 2 dmg like the other weapons, and the corresponding slab
                                    attack is the same as the other two pistols. The point of the marksman is, again in its alt fire. On the basic
                                    sharpshooter, you get three red shots that recharge over [insert time to charge here], these shots can bounce off
                                    walls to target the nearest enemy weakpoint and explode projectiles creating a red explosion [also have a page
                                    about this?] Amounting to great damage. The downside of this attack is the spin uptime as you need to have your right
                                    click pressed down to start the charge up of the gun. this spin-uptime is solved with the slab version which while
                                    it may only have one shot, is more powerful, doesn't require spin uptime at all and stops targeting enemy
                                    weakpoints and while this sounds bad, it actually helps in dealing more consistent damage as the shot stays
                                    straight, and it allows you to, you maybe guessed it, stack coins onto the shot to reset the total amount of bounces
                                    of the shot which makes it great at both single and multi target damage. As talked about in the marksman, the
                                    sharpshooter is a part of the most complex single weapon strategy in the game: the tripleslarpwhipcoinpunch.
                                    This attack uses the bounce resetting property of coins to continually pierce an enemy twice per round. to
                                    set it up, first you take a large enemy, move back and while you are moving back, fire a coin, the moment it is
                                    fired, move back forward to punch it into the enemy in front, then aim at the ground with the slab marksman, fire
                                    a shot, look back at the enemy and punch the coin that should have reached knee height by now, go to the side
                                    and use the grapple to juggle coins upwards, jump to punch the coin into the enemy, slam back down and repeat
                                    until you have run out of coins.

                                    The core eject shotgun is pretty straightforward, left click for a shotgun shot with rather large spread and right click
                                    to charge up an explosive core that can then be shot by any hitscan weapon in the game. It is great for single
                                    target damage and health because it makes the enemies hit bleed a lot contrary to the pistol/revolver that
                                    gives little health. Contrary to the pistol, however, the left click isn't entirely useless as it possesses one of, if
                                    not, the best features in the entire game, projectile boosting which allows you to punch your own bullets when you
                                    fire the weapon. This requires somewhat good timing to get the punching windows; however, once learned and automated,
                                    it becomes second nature. an important thing to note about this feature is that at first it was a bug due to the
                                    way the shotgun was coded as it was simply a copy and paste from the swordsmachine code whose shotgun shots you
                                    can parry to send back to explode, Hakita found this so fun that he decided not to remove it and instead make it
                                    a fully fledged feature. Now for the alt fire, as I said, you can shoot the core with a hitscan, but there is a lot
                                    you can do with this such as shooting it with the malicious railcannon to create a nuke that deals insane amounts
                                    of damage that can one shot cerberus unfortunate enough to find themselves in the blast radius. However, you sadly
                                    cannot projectile boost it even if it's a non-hitscan projectile. NB: coin shots will target these if they are in
                                    the sight of the coin instead of going to the nearest enemy, but this will add damage to the explosion, this works
                                    both with a regular revolver coin shot, the electric railcannon but most fun is the malicious which will make an
                                    even stronger nuke. Now after this yapping, it's time to talk about the alt core eject, aka the jackhammer core eject.
                                    this weapon like the other jackhammers gains damage based on the player speed at the moment of impact through
                                    releasing a piston, this piston can transform the core eject into a hitscan explosion, however hitscan means that
                                    it can now hit coins, this means that you can create an orbital nuke if the coins are shot properly which is a lot
                                    of fun but essentially useless in regular play and only serves as a cool thing to do in the sandbox.

                                    The pump charge has the same wide spread as the core eject but with the right click charging up the shotgun
                                    up to three times. when charged up twice, you receive no damage and get more pellets and a better projectile boost
                                    but if you charge it up thrice, the shotgun will explode when shot dealing 50 damage to you but also dealing a
                                    lot of damage to the enemies in the blast radius, this damage can be negated with a carefully timed dash to
                                    abuse the I-frames of it. The double charge plus knukleblaster can be used to one shot a maurice due to the big
                                    single target damage up close and the triple pump to gain good height for speedruns or even distance, though slam
                                    storage long jump or dash jump is more useful and doesn't have the downside of the potential damage taken. The
                                    jackhammer pump functions the same with each pump making it so the impact shot deals more damage and the third
                                    pump making an explosion. Overall, the pump jackhammer can be better suited for single target damage, though you lose out on projectile boosting and shotgun swapping depending on what other shotguns you have and in what slot
                                    it is. plus, the pump jackhammer, in particular, requires a lot more game knowledge and anticipation than the others
                                    as it has a higher potential for damage when charged but if you don't it kinda blows, but it's well the time to
                                    learn as it can be useful in the cyber grind to stun hideous masses with enough speed and a good hit on the tail.

                                    The sawed off has actually a tighter spread compared to the other two shotguns with the same amount of damage. No one
                                    gives a shit about the damage of the left click, though as its worth is in the right click which charges up a chainsaw
                                    that's attached on a cable. When released, the chainsaw will launch off and come back to you dealing damage both ways
                                    to enemies in its path. The good thing is that this can be rebounded with the feedbacker, adding damage to the
                                    chainsaw, and this can be done infinitely many times stacking damage till the end of time. Using the knukleblaster,
                                    however, will instead detach the projectile and this will then bounce off a few surfaces before disintegrating. This
                                    broken off version can actually be included in saw-blade traps as it is magnetic and can also serve as a conductor for
                                    the jumpstart. the jackhammer variant is functionally the same, still keeping the more speed = more damage of the
                                    weapon, but for this the blast of the left click jackhammer can also serve as a means to rebound the chainsaw after it
                                    is fired, though it requires tighter timing due to the delay in the left click for these weapons.

                                    The attractor nailgun fires, you guessed it nails, nails that can be caught in a
                                    trap using the right click magnets of the gun creating a nail trap, this, however,
                                    is kinda pointless, and few people use this. The most sensible people will go for the
                                    alt saw-blade launcher that fires saw-blades instead of puny nails. This is extremely
                                    useful for all aspects of the game. It can deal with both large groups of boilerplate
                                    enemies and bosses with a saw-blade setup. Although, the timing of the magnets
                                    needs to be on point otherwise they disintegrate, and your trap is ruined. Another
                                    more recent usage of the nails, saw-blade and magnet is with the jumpstart nail gun
                                    as these elements will greatly help conduct the electric shock from the weapon
                                    allowing piercer that is very versatile as it can be utilized in essentially every room due
                                    to the somewhat small size of the trap with the only thing to be careful with is
                                    if the blades are hitting the surface and bouncing off as this can very quickly destroy
                                    them with the repeated ricochets.

                                    The overheat nailgun posses a slower left click, however, each shot will increase the heat
                                    gauge of the weapon. This gauge allows the user to release a large number of nails, thus very quickly,
                                    with a right click. The fire will increase damage to certain enemies like the
                                    insurrectionist while reducing it on enemies such as the schism. You have two charges of
                                    this which each takes 8 seconds to recharge. Additionally, any other variant of the nailgun
                                    will charge the overheat gauge. Making the quick switch between variants to this one for a
                                    big burst of damage. These nails, as said in the attractor nailgun section,
                                    help conduct the charge from the jumpstart. As such, it can be invaluable to fire
                                    out a bunch of nails using the right click to cover most of the arena
                                    with nails which then deal swaths of damage to all nearby enemies. This tech is
                                    most useful in the cybergrind as you have a small window of time between waves
                                    that can allow you to unleash all these nails in peace. The alt fire replaces the
                                    large number of nails with a single yellow blade with the right click with the left
                                    click simply releasing small and weak grey blades. The alt fire's penetration and so
                                    lifetime will depend on how much heat was in the weapon before the alt fire was
                                    released, adding another layer to a good saw blade trap.

                                    The jumpstart is one of the newer weapons introduced in the arsenal update, but
                                    it has already cemented itself as a weapon of choice for any situation due to its
                                    high single and multi-target damage. Both the main and alt variants have normal left
                                    click ability, but it shines again through the alt fire. This alt fire fires a wire
                                    that can connect to enemies. After charging up until it is fully charged, it releases
                                    a blast of electricity which can bounce off enemies. The range of the bounce will depend on how
                                    many metallic objects are near the enemy(ies) when the blast is released, and how they are
                                    positioned. Many things count as metallic objects. Notably, coins, all projectiles from
                                    the nailguns/saw blades, rockets, though this is only useful if using the freezeframe ability
                                    making it hard to implement and the chainsaw from the sawed-of.

                                    The piercing gatorade is a very powerful hitscan weapon with infinite pierce that does 8 damage to all enemies in
                                    its path, as shown when you pick it up in 2–2. It has a universal 16-second cooldown which means that the cooldown is
                                    the same for all other variants, but the cooldown will be taken into account even if you change your weapon to another
                                    one. This cooldown is indicated in the bottom of your screen if you have the default UI layout, and it is shown with
                                    the blue lightning rod that will slowly fill up over time after the gun is shot. This weapon's power is most used for
                                    railcoining as discussed in the marksman description. Though, with the arsenal update, its usage has increased slightly with the
                                    electric shock it now gives to both V1 and nearby enemies when fired in water, though this is only ever useful to know
                                    in 5-3 as the level is by default filled with water unless you for the challenge route but even then you still have
                                    water where you can operate this tech. It doesn't possess any right click ability to speak of at it only zooms your
                                    vision, supposed to make hit far away targets like coins and enemies easier, for you thought no one really uses
                                    it past a certain skill point as any precision aiming lose time, and it would be easier to just grapple anyway.

                                    No one uses the drill. Though if you may know, it's unlocked from the terminal for 100k points and serves more as a healing
                                    device for people with skill issues than anything else. It fires a non hitscan drill that latches onto enemies and starts
                                    dealing small continuous damage to the target over 7.5 seconds, giving out large amounts of blood. You can also punch the drill
                                    while it's in an enemy to instantly deal with the remaining damage. Additionally, if your aim is good enough, you can punch it into anothe ennemy
                                    resetting the timer and the damage starts over again. Moreover, the drill may pierce through enemies, if said enemies have little
                                    to no health, rendering them one-shot. The long cooldown for the railcannons and the very limited tech of the drill makes it useless to players with
                                    higher skill and serves more as a crutch for newer players attempting difficult bossfights, namely minos and Sisyphus prime.
                                    The drill is, however, metallic, meaning it can conduct jumpstart shocks. It can also serve to restrain mindflayers for the
                                    duration of the drill, making them unable to teleport, which is about the only use of it for high skill players. However, even then they
                                    would be better off railcoining the thing instead because it's a one-shot and is cooler.

                                    The baja blast is the last railcannon you unlock costing 100k points from the terminal just like the drill. It fires a yellow hitscan
                                    explosion that does good damage in a large radius with zero damage falloffs, making it excellent against group of fodder enemies and
                                    single tanky like cerberi alike. the shot being hitscan means it can bounce off coins that, just like with any other thing in this game,
                                    will add damage to the explosion, making it somewhat useful in the Cybergrind, though it's not the most efficient use of both the coins
                                    due to the long cooldown and the long recharge time for a kinda small explosion. Real gamers will use a nuke, a nuke is when you fire
                                    a core from the core eject shotgun and then shoot it with the baja blast. This creates a large red explosion powerful enough to instakill
                                    cerberi in the main blast zone. It also serverly weakens those in the secondary radius, this is mostly seen in the weezer room as it
                                    serves to quickly dispatch the 4 cerberi with ease to only have to deal with the ferryman

                                    The freezeframe rocket launcher and the rocket launchers in general are unlocked in 5-3 ship of fools
                                    at the midway part of the level just before the ship turns upside down and you have to make your way
                                    back to the entrance which is now the exit. The left click fires a simple rocket that will deal knockback
                                    to nearby ennemies if it doesn't hit anything and a yellow explosion if it does hit an ennemy.
                                    The way the gun reloads makes rocket swapping impossible which is big le bad. However to make up for
                                    this horrendous if you hit an ennemy with a rocket while said ennemy is in mid air the yellow booom will
                                    be replaced by a red one dealing double damage. This does require a somewhat good amount of skill as
                                    you need to predict where the ennemy is going to be when the rocket reaches his y axis. now for the right
                                    click ability, this one will freeze the rocket for up to 5 seconds with a 10 second cooldown but you can
                                    just right click again even during this cooldown to freeze some more rockets, after one second of being
                                    frozen however the rockets become freeze charged and on impact will deal a red exxplosion, this is
                                    notciced by the orange stripes of the rocket turning blue with an audible zap sfx at the same time. These
                                    rockets can then be shot with the baja blast for an explosion almost as big as the core eject + nuke
                                    combo. none of this matters whoever because the best usage of the freezeframe is the ability to easily
                                    rocket ride by either rc+fire+jump+dash+rc to get on the rocket when on the ground and stationary or by
                                    being in mid air, firering a rocket slightly underneath you while freezeframed, dashing and unfreezing
                                    to land on top of the rocket. There are other ways but no one uses them or cares enough about them so
                                    meh. Finally a niche usage of the freezeframe is the ability to freeze rockets from guttertanks allowing
                                    you to jump onto them and redirecting them towards anything you want by riding and creating a red
                                    explosion on impact with an ennemy also being able to one shot guttertanks.

                                    The S.R.S which i will now write srs because i don't want to write all the dots all the time when refering
                                    to this weapon is the green variant of the rocket launcher. The left click is exactly the same as the blue
                                    variant just like with every other weapon in the game excluding the railguns because they want to be special.
                                    So what makes this weapon interesting the right click which fires out a litteral cannon ball. This ball is a
                                    non hitscan projectile which means it can be projectile booster like a shotgun blast. The ball will simple
                                    disintegrate when it hits a surface that isn't an ennmy and bounce upwards when it does actually hit an ennmy.
                                    This means that you can hit an ennmy with it, and projectile boost the ball afterwards dealing even more
                                    damage. Note that the ball can be grappled towards you so if you are foolish enough to want to use this at longer
                                    ranges, you can, though, when projectile boosted the ball will explode on any contact. So be somewhat smart about
                                    it since it does have a somewhat long cooldown. there is a few tech bits you can do with it such as instakilling
                                    a cerberus by hitting it with the ball first then projectile boosting it into it again, another good use of
                                    this gun is its ability to stun insurectionists though in regular play it isn't all that interesting and
                                    actually comes in handy in the cybergrind as those are ennemies you want to prioritize or at least have out of
                                    your way to deal with other threats. there is also a tech called my balls explode where you fire the canon ball
                                    normally and shoot it with a hitscan weapon to make it detonate creating a short lingering explosion ball that can be
                                    quite handy to kill fodder ennemies like filth and obvioulsy hitting it with a baja blast makes a red explosion because
                                    it would be pretty boring otherwise.

                                    The firestarter is the last of the weapons in the game with some semi interesting tech. Left click is
                                    still the same cause why the hell would it change? Anyway, the right click will just spill oil on the
                                    floor that you can light on fire to deal damage to both yourself and ennemies. The oil will actually
                                    eliminate all friction from walking which means you can use it to preserve speed and have faster dashjumps
                                    because you don't loose momentum from touching the floor. This oil can also be applied to walls and
                                    ceilings but that isn't really useful. Underwater however the oil will simply explode when you put it on
                                    fire. This oil can be applied to ennemies however which will just set them on fire, what else did you really
                                    expect from it? This does have special properties such as making oiled up maurices vulnerable to explosions
                                    which is the only way to achieve this. Some ennemies will also actually take extra fire damage such as the
                                    flesh panopticon, the insurrectionist and of couse sisiphus prime, cause, well reasons.
