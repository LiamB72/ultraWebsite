            <p>
                Greetings machine! This website was made by two people: me aka Stormy and Liam aka Unknown, for a school project.
                This project, which is still yet unfinished as there will be more added in the future as we gather more coding
                 experience, was fully inspired by our mutual love for the game Ultrakill on which we have spent copious amounts of
                time both in game and in the community for all the fire memes they have which you can see all throughout the page in 
                more or less hidden areas including the favicon because why not?
                This was very fun to do (((even if we spent a lot of the winter holidays playing modded Terraria instead of actively
                working on this))) but the finished product is still something we are very proud of as we spent a lot of time thinking
                and tinkering with the various UIs to make something near and dear to our hearts. This can be seen especially in the 
                levels and weapons page as they fully take from the actual in game menus, and even though we wanted to add more content
                like a "pop culture" one to discuss the memes and impact of the game on the internet through the music and the new 
                standard of movement shooters, we didn't quite know how to approach this section as it would have been quite major
                to not skip over any important information.
            </p>
            <p class="title"><b>Behind the scenes</b></p>
            <p>
                I'll start with Liam here. He took care of the Javascript you see on the weapons page after we decided to completely remodel
                that page as it wasn't on par with what we wanted to do with the website, and he also did the header right at the start
                of the project as he is the one who started it and invited me in. He did, however, also do a good amount of backend work
                cleaning up my messy, but functional code, as we went along since he knows how to organize things whereas I don't really
                think about that at the moment, and for that I am very grateful.

                As for me, Stormy, I came up with all the Levels page design as well as doing the backgrounds, resizing images, that you see
                in the act pages and the weapons tab, so that they all followed the same format which was quite the pain to do in GIMP but
                was necessary to keep the website looking consistent. I also wrote all the weapon descriptions myself as I felt using the wiki
                wasn't very fun, and I really wanted to input my own thoughts on the weapoons as my over 200 hours of playtime qualify me to discuss
                them properly. I also did some of the more niche things like the favicons where I had fun putting memes in (after asking Unknown
                first ofc). I learned a lot about web development, and I hope to carry on work on this website throughout my years at university.
